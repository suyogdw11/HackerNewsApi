  Here I have used Refit to call the external HackerNewsAPI Endpoints.

  Some conceptual points for Refit
  
  Refit is an automatic type-safe REST library for .NET. It is heavily inspired by Squareâ€™s Retrofit library, Refit turns a REST API into a live interface.
  Refit reduces the amount of code required to call APIs by eliminating the need to manually construct HTTP requests and handle responses.
  It provides automatic serialization and deserialization of data.
